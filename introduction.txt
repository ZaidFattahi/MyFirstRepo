# Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Zaid FATTAHI. I am a student at ISGI, currently pursuing a degree in Business Management with a focus on Accounting and Finance. I am passionate about sports—especially football, boxing, and basketball—as well as everything related to cars.

I have previous experience in sales and have worked in a call center, which helped me build strong communication skills. I am also involved in academic projects related to education and statistics. I'm excited to learn more about GitHub and version control systems as part of my tech journey.
